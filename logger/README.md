# Runtime Logger

The Runtime Logger is a simple, robust, lightweight interface for the various processes in Runtime to report problems or status updates and collect them in one location. The output can be routed to standard output, to a file, sent on the network to Dawn/Shepherd, or some combination of the three. The logger can be configured through the logger configuration file, so that the user does not need to recompile the entire system to change the logger output locations and levels.

## Description

`logger.h` contains the header file detailing the available functions for the logger. Source code for the logger is found in `logger.c`. 

The list of log levels are enumerated in `logger.h`, and are, in order from lowest to highest priority: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`. There is also a sixth level, `PYTHON`, which is used by `executor` to output stack traces generated by errors in student code. Internally, it has a level that is in between `WARN` and `ERROR`.

`logger.config` is where the user configures where the outputs of the logs will appear, the minimum log level that will be output at each location, and the location of the log file. This file is read during the logger initialization by the calling process in order to set the logger configurations for the duration of that process. Therefore, to change the log settings for a given process, a user can simply exit the process, change the `logger.config` file, save the configuration file, and then restart the process, without needing to recompile the process from source. See the comments in `logger.config` for more information about the specific values given in the configuration.

## Todos

1) Potentially add custom filters for logs (printing between certain times, printing only from one process, printing at different log levels for different processes, etc.).
